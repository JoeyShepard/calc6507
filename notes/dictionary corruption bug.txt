clarify usage of dict_save
==========================

emu6507.asm
-init to be equal to dict_ptr

forth.asm
- in DictEnd which is only called in ; and VAR
   points to old word. writes address of new word to next word field of last word

main.asm
- copied to dict_ptr always in case anything goes wrong
- discards anything added since last word 




clarify usage of new_dict_ptr
=============================

forth.asm
-in AllocMem - holds potential new address
-in WriteToken - copied to dict_ptr

main.asm
-in .value_compile
   THIS IS PROBABLY IT - though errors with word too
   
words.asm
-in :
   after WriteHeader. copies to dict_ptr like WriteToken
