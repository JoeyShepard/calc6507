v1 - first circuit board
     - basically just because voltage sagged on breadboard
     - worked fine but not enough room for power supply
v2 - second circuit board. did not work correctly then crystal died.
     - later, turned out crystal was not dead
       - replaced crystal and system still unstable. turned out to be power supply.
v3 - second circuit board. replaced crystal then started over with tests.
     - same problems as before
     - last test with new power supply worked
v4 - second circuit board. replaced power supply with tps61023 and seems to work.
     - still had problems with reliability
     - stopped using EEPROM adapter and now LCD and RAM good
v5 - second circuit board. should be done with tests
