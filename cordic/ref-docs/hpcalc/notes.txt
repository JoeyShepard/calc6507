original forum post:

old/ is original tests from hpcalc forum before figured out how to do atan and asin

new/ is copy of that much later to make sure base 10 calculation works before implementing in assembly
- cordic-modified.py
  - atan works but asin gives wrong answers
  - compiled original file from voidware and confirms asin works
  - is problem that this way won't work with base 10?
    - tried in cordic-base-2-modified.py below and didn't work
  - posted on forum
- cordic-base-2-modified.py
  - tried making equivalent changes to base 2 version to see if error is in method or how implemented
  - correct answer except negative so problem must by in method not implementation

- cordic-double.py
  - other example showed double method for arcsin so try that

linked-pdf
- pdf linked in hpcalc thread
    - not sure if it's the pdf mentioned in source
- second pdf from other thread "best on decimal CORDIC"
    - https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/post-13347.html
    - actually, not that useful
